# Antispoofing Project

## Overview
This project implements an antispoofing model using deep learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using images and videos.

## Project Structure
- `antispoofing2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the main code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `model_weights/`: Directory containing model weight files.
- `Images/`: Directory for training and testing images.
- `NewImages/`: Additional directory for images.
- `Videos/`: Directory for video files.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd antispoofing-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook antispoofing2.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the datasets used in the project.
- Adjust the paths in the notebook as needed based on your directory structure.
